Hello, I'm **Sweetmimike** and this is the presentation of my mod **Perfect Mob Farm**

## Presentation

Perfect Mob farm is a simple mod that new blocks called Mob Farms. These new blocks allow the player to generate loot passively after having correctly setup the mob farms.

To setup a mob farm, firstly you have to craft a **Mob Shard** and link it to a mob type by right clicking on the mob you want to generate loot. Then, when your mob shard is linked to a mob, you have to fill it by killing mob of the same type. Finally, just put the shard in the mob farm and enjoy ! Your mob farm will start **generating** loot.
